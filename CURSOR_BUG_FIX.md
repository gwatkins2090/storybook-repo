# Spirit Cursor Bug Fix

## Problem

The Spirit Cursor component was causing a critical UX issue in the component showcase:

### Symptoms
- When viewing the Cursors section, the custom cursor would activate
- The cursor would remain active even after navigating to other sections
- Users couldn't click on anything or expand other sections
- The default cursor was hidden globally with no way to restore it

### Root Cause

The `SpiritCursor` component was designed to be a **global cursor replacement** that:
1. Sets `document.body.style.cursor = 'none'` to hide the default cursor
2. Listens to mouse events on the entire document
3. Only restores the cursor when the component unmounts

In a single-page application (SPA) like our showcase, the component stays mounted even when switching between sections, so the cursor effect persisted globally.

## Solution

Created a **scoped demo version** of the cursor that only affects its container.

### New Component: `SpiritCursorDemo`

**File:** `src/components/spirit/SpiritCursorDemo.tsx`

**Key Features:**
1. **Scoped to container**: Only affects the area it's rendered in
2. **Safe for demos**: Doesn't modify global cursor settings
3. **Hover-based**: Only shows custom cursor when hovering over the container
4. **Relative positioning**: Uses container-relative coordinates instead of document coordinates
5. **Automatic cleanup**: Restores normal cursor when mouse leaves the area

### Implementation Details

```tsx
// Container-scoped event listeners
container.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
container.addEventListener('mouseenter', handleMouseEnter);
container.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave);

// Cursor only hidden within container
className={`relative w-full h-full ${isHovering ? 'cursor-none' : ''}`}

// Position relative to container, not document
const rect = containerRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
mouseX = e.clientX - rect.left;
mouseY = e.clientY - rect.top;
```

### Usage

**For Component Showcase (Safe Demo):**
```tsx
import { SpiritCursorDemo } from '@/components/spirit';

<div className="h-[500px]">
  <SpiritCursorDemo />
</div>
```

**For Production (Global Cursor):**
```tsx
import { SpiritCursor } from '@/components/spirit';

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <SpiritCursor />
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Files Changed

### 1. Created New Component
- **`src/components/spirit/SpiritCursorDemo.tsx`** (new)
  - Scoped version safe for demos
  - Container-relative positioning
  - Hover-based activation

### 2. Updated Exports
- **`src/components/spirit/index.ts`**
  - Added export for `SpiritCursorDemo`

- **`src/components/index.ts`**
  - Added export for `SpiritCursorDemo`

### 3. Updated Showcase
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**
  - Changed import from `SpiritCursor` to `SpiritCursorDemo`
  - Updated cursor section to use demo version
  - Added code example showing both versions

## Benefits

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- ✅ Cursor no longer persists when navigating away
- ✅ Users can click and interact normally
- ✅ Cursor effect is clearly scoped to demo area
- ✅ No global side effects

### ✅ Improved UX
- ✅ Clear visual boundary for cursor effect
- ✅ Informative message: "Move your cursor here"
- ✅ Note indicating effect is scoped
- ✅ Smooth transition when entering/leaving area

### ✅ Better Documentation
- ✅ Code example shows both demo and production usage
- ✅ Clear distinction between scoped and global versions
- ✅ Users understand when to use each version

## Testing

### Before Fix
1. Navigate to Cursors section ❌
2. Custom cursor activates ❌
3. Try to navigate to another section ❌ (can't click)
4. Cursor remains custom everywhere ❌

### After Fix
1. Navigate to Cursors section ✅
2. Hover over demo area → custom cursor activates ✅
3. Move mouse outside demo area → normal cursor returns ✅
4. Click on other sections → works perfectly ✅
5. Navigate anywhere → no cursor issues ✅

## Component Comparison

### SpiritCursor (Global)
- **Scope:** Entire document
- **Use case:** Production sites wanting custom cursor everywhere
- **Activation:** Always active (non-touch devices)
- **Cleanup:** On component unmount only
- **Best for:** Root layout component

### SpiritCursorDemo (Scoped)
- **Scope:** Container only
- **Use case:** Demos, showcases, specific sections
- **Activation:** On hover over container
- **Cleanup:** On mouse leave
- **Best for:** Component showcases, limited areas

## Recommendations

### For Component Library Users

**Use `SpiritCursor` when:**
- You want a custom cursor for your entire site
- You're adding it to your root layout
- You want consistent cursor behavior everywhere

**Use `SpiritCursorDemo` when:**
- You want to demo the cursor effect
- You only want custom cursor in specific areas
- You're building a component showcase
- You want to avoid global side effects

### For Future Components

When creating components that modify global state (cursor, scroll, etc.):
1. **Always provide a scoped demo version** for showcases
2. **Document the scope** clearly (global vs. scoped)
3. **Show both usage patterns** in examples
4. **Test in SPA context** to ensure proper cleanup

## Summary

The bug has been completely resolved by creating a scoped demo version of the Spirit Cursor component. Users can now safely explore the cursor effect in the showcase without any negative side effects. The original global version remains available for production use, and both versions are properly documented with clear usage examples.
